    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> I am working towards a career in veterinary medicine, I'm also working to achieve a bright futures scholarship so it will save more money so I can pay less for 8 years of college. I am also working on being more responsible with deadlines and hope to be someone my team can rely on. I am currently working on taking all 7 AICE courses to get into bright futures without having a high SAT and ACT score and I'm making sure my GPA is always above a 3.0 at the end of all the quarters. I am also currently working on submitting my assignments on time and trying to find a balance with school and other activities such as family, friends, etc.. I fell that a value that is most important to my success is determination, this is because if I am motivated enough I can achieve anything. A short goal term I have that I wish to accomplish soon is to save up five hundred dollars towards a car by this summer, I already have more than half of that sum saved up. Some characteristics I'm known for by my peers is being humorous and nice. Many others also think I am polite and social. My family and friends also know I have a hobby for art and enjoy drawling.</p>
